ReBuild3 - Decentralized Verifiable Crowdfunding for helping people to rebuild anything which was damaged as a result of war, natural disaster, etc. 

1. A dApp crowd-funding platform (rebuild3.xyz) to solve challenges of rebuilding destructions post war/natural disaster.
2. The platform should allow submitting a request for rebuild with specific expense criteria details, including information for how much what costs.
3. A person can donate for specific restoration application.
4. Every country has its own list of organizations which can review the application, and approve for initial work with subsequent review, if the work is not done for specific steps, the money is returned.
5. The approval process is split into 10-20% increments, to make sure that the person actually rebuilding his house, and not using the money for anything else.
6. The system should not allow the approver to get money or send it to anyone else, the only thing it can do is approve an "escrow" for realeasing funds.
7. Approver itself should be an DAO organisation, so it's not only one wallet which approves, to avoid errors.
8. The approver gets % fee for doing his work.
9. There should be some way where the approver can register in the system and prove that it's a known NGO or DAO of people willing to do the work in a open/transperent/trust manner,
which requires some reputation system.
